# Exercise 3

* Add a code block that loads the {psych} package and a dataset from the package e.g. `bfi`. 
  * Alternatively, use some other data that you have/like.
* Add another code block that makes a plot e.g. a bar chart of participants' education categories, `education`. You can use either base R or {ggplot2} (or another package!).
* Change the code block options and see what happens!
* Add a third code block that creates a table showing the first 10 rows and first 5 columns of your data. Hint: `head(bfi[, 1:5], 10)`. Use any table package you prefer.
