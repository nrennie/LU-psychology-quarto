We see a bar chart of the gender and education level of participants below:

#| label: gen-edu-barplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-cap: "Education and gender (Males = 1, Females = 2) of participants."
# Add a bar plot of gender and education
barplot(
  table(bfi$gender, bfi$education),
  beside = TRUE,
  legend = TRUE
)
```

A table of agreeableness scores for the first 10 participants is shown below:

```{r}
#| label: sample-table
