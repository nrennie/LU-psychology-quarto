# 25 Personality items representing 5 factors

Data exploration will be discussed in @sec-data-exp.

## Description

25 personality self report items taken from the International Personality Item Pool ([ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/)) were included as part of the **Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA)** web based personality assessment project. The data from 2800 subjects are included here as a demonstration set for scale construction, factor analysis, and Item Response Theory analysis.

Three additional demographic variables are also included:

* sex
* education
* age

## Data exploration {#sec-data-exp}

Here we explore `bfi` data in the {psych} package [@psych].

```{r}
#| label: load-data
library(psych)
data(bfi)
```

We see a bar chart of the gender and education level of participants below in @fig-gen-edu-barplot.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gen-edu-barplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-cap: "Education and gender (Males = 1, Females = 2) of participants."
# Add a bar plot of gender and education
barplot(
  table(bfi$gender, bfi$education),
  beside = TRUE,
  legend = TRUE
)
```

A table of agreeableness scores for the first 10 participants is shown below:

```{r}
#| label: sample-table
library(tinytable)
tt(head(bfi[, 1:5], 10))
```
